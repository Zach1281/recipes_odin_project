<p>Description:</p>
<p>Vanilla is frequently used to flavor ice cream, especially in North America and Europe. Vanilla ice cream, like other flavors of ice cream, was originally created by cooling a mixture made of cream, sugar, and vanilla above a container of ice and salt. The type of vanilla used to flavor ice cream varies by location. In North America and Europe, using either vanilla extract or vanilla sugar gives the ice cream a pale off-white color and strong vanilla flavor. Madagascar vanilla is the predominant type of vanilla used for ice cream in North America and Europe, typically used in either extract or pod form. Vanilla ice cream ranges from yellow to white depending on the type of vanilla used, the amount, and whether or not egg yolks are added for a more custard-like flavor.</p>
