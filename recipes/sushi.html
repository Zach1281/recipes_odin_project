<p>Description:</p>
<p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯꜜɕi] or [sɯɕiꜜ]) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 <emp>1/3</emp> cups water</li>
    <li><emp>2/3</emp> cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 <emp> 1/2</emp> tablespoons salt</li>
    <li>1 <emp> 1/2</emp> tablespoons salt</li>
    <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
    <li><emp>1/2</emp> cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips</li>
    <li><emp>2/3</emp> avocado, pitted, sliced</li>
    <li><emp>1/2</emp> pound fresh sushi-grade tuna, cut into small strips</li>
    <li><emp>1/2</emp> pound fresh sushi-grade salmon, cut into small strips</li>
    <li><emp>1/2</emp> cup pickled ginger</li>
    <li><emp>1/2</emp> cup soy sauce</li>
    <li><emp>1/4</emp> cup wasabi paste</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Combine water and rice in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Rice should be tender and water should be absorbed. Cool until cool enough to handle.</li>
    <li>In a small saucepan, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt. Cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Cool, then stir into the cooked rice. When you pour this in to the rice it will seem very wet. Keep stirring and the rice will dry as it cools.</li>
    <li>On a bamboo mat, place one sheet of nori with the rough side facing upwards. Wet your fingers. Using your fingers, spread a thin layer of rice on the sheet of nori, and press into a thin layer. Arrange 1/4 of the cucumber, ginger, avocado, tuna and salmon in a line down the center of the rice. Lift the end of the mat, and gently roll it over the ingredients, pressing gently. Roll it forward to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
    <li>Cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices using a wet, sharp knife.</li>
    <li>Serve with pickled ginger, soy sauce and wasabi paste.</li>
